### Welcome to Brain Boost ASQ-IT! <br>
In our Explainable AI (XAI) System, we offer a variety of environments. Based on your inputted requirements, you can observe and analyze how the agents act and understand the nature of the switch. To help you gain clear insights, we generate videos that visualize, providing a deep understanding of the agents' decision-making processes.<br>
In addition to these pre-built environments, our platform allows you to train and visualize agents through the 'Agents' section. Whether you're working with existing environments or creating your own, we provide all the tools you need to see your agents in action. You can even build your own custom environment, train the agent, and watch as we plot the agent's behaviors for you to explore and understand through the 'Custom Environment' section.<br>
