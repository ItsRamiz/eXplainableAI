# Importing Required Libraries and Modules

# ------------------------------------------------------------

#

# The code starts by importing necessary modules and functions.

# It first imports 'annotations' from the '__future__' module

# to enable forward references in type hints, which allows for

# better readability and maintainability of type annotations.

#

# The code then imports 'TYPE_CHECKING' from 'typing', which

# is used for conditional imports that are only required during

# type checking and not during runtime execution.

#

# Additionally, it imports the 'Tuple' type hint from 'typing',

# which is used to annotate a tuple consisting of two integers

# (Point).

#

# Numpy is imported as 'np' for handling arrays and numerical

# operations in rendering the grid environment.

#

# Several constants related to object types and colors

# (like COLOR_TO_IDX, COLORS, OBJECT_TO_IDX) are imported from

# the 'minigrid.core.constants' module, which maps object types

# and colors to their respective indices.

#

# Lastly, utility functions (fill_coords, point_in_circle, etc.)

# are imported from 'minigrid.utils.rendering', which assist

# in rendering the grid and objects within it.

# Defining the Base Class WorldObj

# ------------------------------------------------------------

#

# The 'WorldObj' class is the base class for all grid world objects.

# It defines the fundamental attributes and methods that are common

# across all objects in the grid. This includes attributes like

# 'type' (the object type) and 'color' (the object color), which

# are both validated against the 'OBJECT_TO_IDX' and 'COLOR_TO_IDX'

# dictionaries during initialization.

#

# The class also includes several key methods that define the behavior

# of objects. These methods include:

#

# - `can_overlap()`: Determines if the agent can overlap with this

#   object. By default, this returns False, meaning most objects

#   cannot be overlapped by the agent unless specifically allowed.

#

# - `can_pickup()`: Determines if the agent can pick up this object.

#   Similar to 'can_overlap', it defaults to False and needs to be

#   overridden for objects like keys or balls that the agent can carry.

#

# - `can_contain()`: Specifies if this object can contain other

#   objects, defaulting to False.

#

# - `see_behind()`: Determines whether the agent can see behind the

#   object. By default, most objects allow this, returning True.

#

# - `toggle()`: Defines behavior when the object is toggled or

#   interacted with by the agent. By default, this does nothing,

#   returning False.

#

# - `encode()`: Encodes the object’s type, color, and state as a tuple

#   of integers, which can be used to recreate or identify the object.

#

# - `decode()`: A static method that decodes a 3-tuple of integers to

#   recreate the object instance based on its type, color, and state.

#   This function checks the type of the object, such as walls, doors,

#   or lava, and returns the appropriate object.

#

# Each object also stores its initial position (`init_pos`) and its

# current position (`cur_pos`), both of which are optional and default

# to None.

#

# ------------------------------------------------------------





# ------------------------------------------------------------

# Subclasses of WorldObj (Goal, Floor, Lava, Wall, Door, etc.)

# ------------------------------------------------------------

#

# Several subclasses of 'WorldObj' are defined to represent different

# types of objects that can exist in the grid environment. Each subclass

# represents a specific object, such as goals, floors, lava, walls, doors,

# keys, and more. These objects have distinct properties and behaviors.

#

# 1. **Goal Class:**

#

#    - This class represents the goal object in the grid.

#    - It inherits from 'WorldObj' with the type set to "goal" and

#      the color set to "green".

#    - The 'can_overlap()' method is overridden to return True,

#      indicating that the agent can step on the goal.

#    - The 'render()' method defines how the goal is drawn on the grid.

#

# 2. **Floor Class:**

#

#    - Represents floor tiles that the agent can walk over.

#    - The color is customizable (default: "blue").

#    - Similar to 'Goal', the agent can overlap with the floor,

#      so the 'can_overlap()' method returns True.

#    - The 'render()' method gives the floor tile a pale color to

#      visually distinguish it.

#

# 3. **Lava Class:**

#

#    - Represents dangerous lava tiles that the agent can overlap with.

#    - If the agent steps on a lava tile, it could potentially terminate

#      the episode, depending on the game logic.

#    - The 'render()' method gives the lava an orange color, with

#      small wave-like patterns added for visual effect.

#

# 4. **Wall Class:**

#

#    - Represents walls that block the agent’s movement.

#    - The agent cannot see behind walls, so the 'see_behind()' method

#      returns False.

#    - Walls are rendered as solid blocks in their respective colors.

#

# 5. **Door Class:**

#

#    - Doors can be open or closed, and some may be locked.

#    - The 'can_overlap()' method allows the agent to walk through the

#      door only if it is open.

#    - The 'see_behind()' method allows visibility through the door only

#      when it is open.

#    - Doors can be toggled open or closed by the agent, and if locked,

#      the agent must have the correct key to unlock it.

#    - The 'encode()' method encodes the door's state (open, closed, locked).

#    - The 'render()' method visualizes the door in different states.

#

# 6. **Key Class:**

#

#    - Represents keys that the agent can pick up and use to unlock doors.

#    - The 'can_pickup()' method returns True, allowing the agent to

#      carry the key.

#    - The 'render()' method visually distinguishes the key with teeth

#      and a ring.

#

# 7. **Ball Class:**

#

#    - Represents balls that the agent can pick up, similar to keys.

#    - The 'can_pickup()' method is also True for balls, allowing them

#      to be carried by the agent.

#    - The 'render()' method draws the ball as a circle.

#

# 8. **Box Class:**

#

#    - Represents boxes that can contain other objects.

#    - The 'can_pickup()' method allows the agent to carry the box.

#    - If toggled, the box reveals its contents (if any).

#    - The 'render()' method visualizes the box, and if toggled,

#      the box is replaced by its contents.

#

# ------------------------------------------------------------





# ------------------------------------------------------------

# Key Class Methods

# ------------------------------------------------------------

#

# In addition to the basic functionality provided by 'WorldObj', each

# subclass overrides or implements additional functionality specific to

# that type of object. For example:

#

# - In the 'Key' class, the 'can_pickup()' method is overridden to return

#   True, allowing the agent to pick up keys.

#

# - Similarly, in the 'Door' class, the 'toggle()' method implements logic

#   for unlocking the door if the agent has the correct key.

#

# - Each object also has a 'render()' method that specifies how the object

#   is drawn within the grid environment, using coordinates and shapes

#   (rectangles, circles, lines) defined by the rendering utility functions.

#

# ------------------------------------------------------------





# ------------------------------------------------------------

# Encoding and Decoding of Objects

# ------------------------------------------------------------

#

# The encoding and decoding functionality is crucial for maintaining the

# state of the grid. Each object can be encoded into a tuple of integers

# representing its type, color, and state. This allows the environment to

# efficiently store and recreate objects.

#

# - The 'encode()' method creates a 3-tuple based on the object's type,

#   color, and any additional state information (like whether a door is

#   open or locked).

#

# - The 'decode()' static method takes a 3-tuple and returns the corresponding

#   object by checking the object type (wall, door, goal, etc.) and initializing

#   it with the appropriate color and state.

#

# This encoding-decoding system is essential for environments where objects need

# to be saved, reset, or communicated between different parts of the system.

#

# ------------------------------------------------------------





# ------------------------------------------------------------

# Rendering Logic

# ------------------------------------------------------------

#

# Each object type has its own 'render()' method that defines how the object

# should appear within the grid. The rendering utility functions are used to

# draw geometric shapes such as rectangles and circles to visually represent

# objects.

#

# For example, the 'Goal' class renders the goal as a green square, while the

# 'Lava' class renders lava as a red tile with small waves to indicate its

# dangerous nature.

#

# The 'Door' class has more complex rendering logic, as it must visually

# distinguish between open, closed, and locked states. This involves drawing

# the door frame, the keyhole, and the door handle.

#

# These rendering methods ensure that the agent can visually interpret the

# grid and its objects as they navigate through the environment.

#

# ------------------------------------------------------------





# ------------------------------------------------------------

# Conclusion

# ------------------------------------------------------------

#

# The code provides a comprehensive framework for defining various objects

# that populate a grid world environment. The base 'WorldObj' class lays the

# foundation for these objects, while subclasses represent specific object

# types with unique behaviors and appearances.

#

# By using encoding and decoding mechanisms, the environment can efficiently

# manage object states and transitions, which is critical for reinforcement

# learning tasks. The rendering functions further enhance the usability by

# providing clear, visual representations of the grid world.
