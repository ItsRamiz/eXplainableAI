Installing is quite easily done by navigating to rl-starter-files folder

On Windows:

1. Creating a new environment there and activating it
2. pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Install any missing libraries manually

On Linux:

It's quite dependant on the current environment you have installed

1. I've used python3-xyz instead of python

2. Had to upgrade the pip as well

# Ask the creators for more details on installing on linux

Training agents is quite simple and can be done using the following command:

For info regarding the parameters: https://github.com/lcswillems/rl-starter-files

Linux:
python3 -m scripts.train --algo ppo --env MiniGrid-DoorKey-5x5-v0 --model DoorKey --save-interval 10 --frames 80000

Windows:
python -m scripts.train --algo ppo --env MiniGrid-DoorKey-5x5-v0 --model DoorKey --save-interval 10 --frames 80000

For Visualizing:

Linux:
python3 -m scripts.visualize --env MiniGrid-DoorKey-5x5-v0 --model DoorKey

Windows:
python -m scripts.visualize --env MiniGrid-DoorKey-5x5-v0 --model DoorKey


While visualizing the model, I had a trouble closing the window generated, so I had
to manually kill the process using the cmd/terminal.

On Linux:

ps aux | grep python
kill -9 {PROCESS ID}  # Typically it's easy to identify

On Windows:

tasklist | findstr python
taskkill /PID {PROCESS ID} /F # Typicall it's the one with higher Kilobytes.
